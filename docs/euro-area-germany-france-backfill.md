# Euro area, Germany, and France official macro-calendar backfill

Issue #539 owns the first-party reconstruction of euro-area, German, and
French macroeconomic calendar history from 2000 onward. The work is staged by
legal producer and program. A reviewed registry entry is only an acquisition
route; each program remains incomplete until retained artifacts, parser
replay, timing evidence, and previous-as-known lineage have been qualified.

## Complete ECB monetary-policy decision archive

`histdatacom.market_context.ecb_monetary_policy_archive` qualifies the ECB's
complete `Monetary policy decisions` publication series from 5 January 2000
through 10 September 2026. The 15 December 1999 decision is retained as the
predecessor for the first previous-as-known comparison.

The source inventory is the ECB's versioned public FOEDB database, not a URL
guess or a third-party calendar. Replay retains and verifies:

- `versions.json` and its one active database version;
- the versioned `metadata.json` record schema;
- all 81 data chunks containing 20,073 publication records;
- the exact selection predicate: publication type `92` and the
  source-authored title `Monetary policy decisions`;
- the 1999 predecessor and all 298 in-window HTML decision pages; and
- byte length and SHA-256 for every one of the 382 official artifacts.

The retained corpus contains 42,018,085 bytes and 382 distinct SHA-256
digests. Its compact packaged receipt is
`ecb-archive-manifest:sha256:112cdfa7ade349a2ee189b7dc0a3f8c32568925f5516ee349ed69cc336bde408`.

Each decision preserves a native `RATE_SET` with separate components for the
main refinancing operations, marginal lending facility, and deposit facility.
The parser does not assign values by a fixed position: it reads the
source-authored component order. This is essential after 12 September 2024,
when the ECB began presenting the deposit rate first. Ordered comparison with
the preceding official page produces 237 holds, 32 easing decisions, and 29
tightening decisions with no discontinuity in the rate lineage.

FOEDB's publication timestamp has two empirically distinct meanings:

- 226 in-window publications through 7 September 2017 carry date-only
  placeholder epochs and therefore do not receive invented intraday clocks;
- 72 publications from 26 October 2017 onward carry exact minutes, with the
  local decision clock moving from 13:45 to 14:15 Europe/Berlin on 21 July
  2022.

The 17 September 2001 and 8 October 2008 releases are retained as emergency
actions. Other publications belong to the ordinary Governing Council decision
sequence, but that classification does not replace contemporaneous calendar
evidence for a historical scheduled clock. The official archive also does not
publish a historical market-consensus rate set, so the qualification does not
manufacture numeric consensus or surprise values.

An operator with the retained corpus can reproduce the packaged receipt with:

```console
uv run python scripts/refresh_ecb_monetary_policy_archive.py \
  --as-of 2026-09-15 \
  --source-directory /path/to/retained-ecb-corpus
```

The refresh discovers the active database version before constructing bounded
metadata, chunk, and report requests. `--fetch-missing` is explicit; without
it, a missing retained artifact fails closed.

## Remaining issue scope

This ECB decision archive completes one monetary-policy program, not issue
#539 as a whole. Eurostat aggregate releases and the ECB accounts/projections
families, Destatis and Bundesbank programs for Germany, and INSEE and Banque de
France programs for France still require their own empirical archive
qualifications before the regional calendar can produce a closure receipt.
